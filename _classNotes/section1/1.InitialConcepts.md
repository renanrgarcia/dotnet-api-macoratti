## Dependency Injection

- Invertion of dependencies - principle
- Inversion of Control - principle
- Dependency Injection - pattern
- IoC Container - Framework
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection - native DI container. IServiceCollection is used to register dependencies.

- Singleton: single instance
- Scoped: single instance per request. Used on web services.
- Transient: new instance every time
