# DTO - Data Transfer Objects

- Data Transfer Object on .NET is a class that is used to encapsulate data and send it from one subsystem of an application to another.
- It's not a good practice to send entities directly to the client, the recommended is to build domain entities independent of external concerns.
- DTO vs ViewModel: DTO is used to transfer data between layers, while ViewModel is used to transfer data between the controller and the view (MVC pattern).
- DTO can filter the information that will be sent to the client, avoiding sending sensitive data.

## Implementing DTO

- Create a new class/record in the `Models` folder.
  - Ex: `UserDTO.cs`, `ProductDTO.cs`, etc.
- We can use Request/Response classes to handle DTOs. If you choose to use this approach, be consistent with the naming convention.
  - Ex: `UserRequest.cs`, `UserResponse.cs`, etc.
- Mostly, DTOs doesn't have any behavior, they are just data containers.
- Can be applied validation, formatting or other annotations to the DTO properties. Ex: DataAnnotations.
- Input DTOs are used to receive data from the client.
- Output DTOs are used to send data to the client.
