# HttpPatch

- The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
- The operation has 3 properties:
  - `op`: The operation to be performed. Ex: `add`, `replace`, `remove`, `copy`, `move`, `test`.
  - `path`: The path of the property to be modified.
  - `value`: The new value of the property.
  - Ex: { "op": "replace", "path": "/name", "value": "new name" }
- A Action method to JSON Patch:
  - `JsonPatchDocument<T>`: Represents a JSON Patch document with [FromBody].
  - `ApplyTo(Object, ModelState)`: Applies the patch to the object.
  - Has [HttpPatch] annotation.
- NuGet packages:
  - Microsoft.AspNetCore.JsonPatch
  - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson

## Put vs Patch

- PUT
  - Replaces the entire resource.
  - Must send all the properties of the resource.
  - Idempotent, that means that the result of the operation is always the same.
- PATCH: Replaces only the properties that are sent in the request.
  - Partial update.
  - Doesn't need to send all the properties.
  - Not idempotent.
