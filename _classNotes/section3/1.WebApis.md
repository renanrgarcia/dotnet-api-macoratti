# WebApis

- Anemical class: there are no public methods in this class, just properties.

# Layer Architecture

- Layers: logical separation of code and data
  - Presentation layer
  - Business layer
  - Data layer
- Tiers: physical separation of code and data
- Class library or folders? In most cases class library is to much complex to process, being unnecessary on projects running on the same server.

# DBs approachs on Dotnet Apis

- Code-first approach: create classes for the domain entities then generate database and tables
  - EFCore uses migrations
- Database-first approach: generate database and tables then create classes for the domain entities

# Migrations

- `dotnet ef migrations add <name>`
- `dotnet ef migrations remove <name>`
- `dotnet ef database update`

# Populate tables options

- INSERT INTO (Manually on SQL)
- OnModelCreating + HasData (EFCore)
- AddRange (EFCore)
- Empty Magrations > Up() and Down() with INSERT INTO
