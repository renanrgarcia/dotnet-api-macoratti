# Dependency Injection (DI)

- Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing for better separation of concerns and easier testing.
- In DI, an object's dependencies are provided (injected) from the outside rather than the object creating them itself.

## Benefits of Dependency Injection

1. **Decoupling**: Classes are less dependent on concrete implementations, making it easier to change or replace dependencies.
2. **Testability**: Dependencies can be mocked or stubbed during testing, allowing for more straightforward unit tests.
3. **Maintainability**: Code is easier to maintain and extend due to the separation of concerns.

## Types of Dependency Injection

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor. On .NET it is the most common form of DI.

```csharp
class Client
{
    private readonly IService _service;

    public Client(IService service) // Dependency is injected through the constructor
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void DoSomething() => _service.Execute();
}

// Using C# 12 primary constructor syntax:
class Client(IService service) // Dependency is injected through the primary constructor
{
    private readonly IService _service = service;

    public void DoSomething() => _service.Execute();
}
```

2. **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods after the object is constructed.

```csharp
class Client
{
    private IService _service;

    public void SetService(IService service) // Dependency is injected through a setter method
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void DoSomething() => _service.Execute();
}
```

3. **Interface Injection**: The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client that passes itself (the client) to the injector.

```csharp
interface IServiceInjector
{
    void InjectService(IService service);
}

class Client : IServiceInjector
{
    private IService _service;

    public void InjectService(IService service) // Dependency is injected through an interface method
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public void DoSomething() => _service.Execute();
}
```

## Example

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var services = new ServiceCollection(); // This is the IoC container. It is used to register dependencies.
services.AddTransient<IGithubClient, GithubClient>(); // Registering the IGithubClient interface with its implementation GithubClient
services.AddTransient<GithubService>(); // Registering the GithubService which depends on IGithubClient

var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider(); // Build the service provider to resolve dependencies

GithubService githubService = provider.GetRequiredService<GithubService>(); // This creates an instance of GithubService with its dependencies injected

githubService.GetStars("dotnet/aspnetcore").Dump("The repository has {0} stars.", stars);
// Output: The repository has 19 stars.

class GithubService(IGithubClient githubClient) // Using constructor injection
{
private readonly IGithubClient _githubClient = githubClient;

    public int GetStars(string repoName)
    {
        return _githubClient.GetRepo(repoName).Stars;
    }

}

internal interface IGithubClient // Using this, we have Dependency Inversion
{
    (string repoName, int stars) GetRepo(string repoName);
}

class GithubClient : IGithubClient
{
    public (string repoName, int stars) GetRepo(string repoName)
    {
        return (repoName, repoName.Length);
    }
}

```

In this example, the `Client` class depends on the `IService` interface. The actual implementation of `IService` is injected into the `Client` class through the constructor, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

# Inversion of Control (IoC)

- Inversion of Control (IoC) is a broader design principle that refers to the reversal of the flow of control in a system.
- In traditional programming, the flow of control is dictated by the program itself, but with IoC, the control is inverted, allowing for more flexible and modular designs.
- For example, in a web application, the framework (like ASP.NET Core) controls the flow of execution, and the developer provides the components that the framework uses.

# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.
- It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
- Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
