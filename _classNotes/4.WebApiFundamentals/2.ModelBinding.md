# Model Binding

- Model binding is a process of mapping the HTTP request data to the parameters of the action method in the controller.
  Ex:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Post([FromBody] Product product) // Explicitly specifying that the product object is coming from the body of the request
{
  return Ok(product);
}
```

## Data fonts

1. Form data: sent as form data in the body of the request (POST and PUT requests)
2. Query string: sent as query string in the URL (?id=1&name=product&price=10)
3. Route data: sent as route data in the URL ([Route("api/[controller]")] or [HttpGet("{id}")])
4. Header: sent as header in the request (Authorization, Content-Type, etc.)
5. Body: sent as body in the request (JSON, XML, etc.)
6. Services: sent as services in the request (Dependency Injection)
7. Model: sent as model in the request (DTO, ViewModel, etc.)
8. TempData: sent as TempData in the request (used to pass data between requests)

## Model Binding Attributes

1. [BindRequired]: specifies that the parameter is required

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Post([BindRequired] Product product)
{
  return Ok(product);
}
```

2. [BindNever]: specifies that the parameter should not be bound

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Post([BindNever] Product product)
{
  return Ok(product);
}
```

3. [FromQuery]: specifies that the parameter is coming from the query string
4. [FromRoute]: specifies that the parameter is coming from the route data
5. [FromForm]: specifies that the parameter is coming from the form data
6. [FromBody]: specifies that the parameter is coming from the body of the request
7. [FromHeader]: specifies that the parameter is coming from the header of the request
8. [FromServices]: specifies that the parameter is coming from the services container (DI container)

## FromServices

- Enables you to inject services directly into the action method, without having to go through the constructor.
- From .net 7, the dependency is resolved by inferring, without having to specify [FromServices] on the Action method.
  - To unable it you must to do:
  ```csharp
  builder.Services.Configure<ApiBehaviorOptions>(options =>
    {
      options.DisableImplicitFromServicesParameters = true);
    });
  ```
