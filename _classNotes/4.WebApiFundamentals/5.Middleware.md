# Middleware

- Middleware is used to perform operations on the request and response objects, such as logging, authentication, authorization, and error handling.
  - Request > pipeline of middleware > Response
  - Middleware is executed in the order they are added to the pipeline.
- Ex:
  - Logging middleware
  - Authentication middleware
  - Authorization middleware
  - MVC middleware
  - Error handling middleware

## Execution Order

- Request > ExceptionHandler > HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) > HttpsRedirection > StaticFiles > Routing > CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) > Authentication > Authorization > Custom 1 > Custom 2 > ... > Endpoints
- Then, the response is sent back through the middleware in reverse order: Endpoints > Customs > ... > ExceptionHandler > Response
- The order of middleware is important because it determines how requests and responses are processed.

## Request Delegate

- The request delegate is a function that processes an HTTP request.
  Ex:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
  // Do something before the request
  await next(context);
  // Do something after the request
});

app.Run(async context => // Used to terminate the pipeline
{
  await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World");
});
```

## UseExceptionHandler

- Used to handle exceptions, define custom responses, and log errors, including JSON format.

```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
{
  errorApp.Run(async context =>
  {
    context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
    context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";

    var errorFeature = context.Features.Get<IExceptionHandlerFeature>();
    if (errorFeature != null)
    {
      var exception = errorFeature.Error;
      var errorMessage = exception.Message;

      await context.Response.WriteAsync(errorMessage);
    }
  });
});
```
