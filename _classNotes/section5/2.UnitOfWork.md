# Unit of work

- Unit of work is a design pattern that helps to maintain the consistency of the data in the database.
- Martin Fowler defines the Unit of Work pattern as "Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems."
- One context instance per transaction.
- Avoid concurrency issues.
- The repositories operate read/write operations on the context, but not save changes. They prepare the changes and the unit of work saves the changes.
  - The unit of work confirm/rollback the changes, making it happen on a single transaction.

## Implementation

- `IUnitOfWork` interface: has methods to save changes and dispose the context.
- `UnitOfWork` class: implements the `IUnitOfWork` interface and manage one instance of the context.
- Configure the dependency injection to inject the `IUnitOfWork` interface.
