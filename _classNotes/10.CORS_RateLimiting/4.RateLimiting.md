# Rate Limiting

- Rate limiting is a technique used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. It is often used to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect resources from being overwhelmed by too many requests. Main goals include:
  - Preventing abuse and DoS attacks
  - Ensuring fair usage among users
  - Protecting resources from being overwhelmed
- On .NET:
  - ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for rate limiting: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting` package.
  - Rate limiting can be implemented using middleware.
  - It can be configured to limit requests based on various criteria, such as IP address, user ID, or API key.

## Configuring Rate Limiting

```csharp
// Program.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.RateLimiting;

builder.Services.AddRateLimiter("name", options => // Must be called before `AddControllers()` and after `AddAuthentication()`
{
// Configure rate limiting options
});

app.UseRateLimiter("name"); // Must be called after `UseRouting()`

```

- We can use `EnableRateLimiting` to enable rate limiting for specific endpoints or controllers. Or `DisableRateLimiting` to disable it.

```csharp
[EnableRateLimiting("name")]
[HttpGet]
public IActionResult Get()
{
    return Ok("Rate limiting is enabled for this action.");
}

[DisableRateLimiting]
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Post()
{
    return Ok("Rate limiting is disabled for this action.");
}
```

## Rate Limiting Algorithms

- There are several algorithms for rate limiting, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some common algorithms include:
  - **Fixed Window**: Limits requests within a fixed time window (e.g., per minute).
  - **Sliding Window**: Similar to fixed window but allows for more flexibility in request timing.
  - **Token Bucket**: Allows a burst of requests up to a certain limit, then enforces a steady rate.
  - **Leaky Bucket**: Similar to token bucket but enforces a constant rate of requests.
  - **Simultaneous Connections**: Limits the number of concurrent connections from a single client.

### Fixed Window

- `AddFixedWindowLimiter` is a rate limiting algorithm that allows a fixed number of requests within a specified time window. It is simple to implement and understand, but it can lead to burst traffic at the beginning of each time window.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.AddFixedWindowLimiter("fixed", options =>
    {
        options.PermitLimit = 5; // Maximum number of requests
        options.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1); // Time window
        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst; // Order of processing requests
        options.QueueLimit = 2; // Maximum number of requests in the queue
    });
    options.RejectionStatusCode = StatusCodes.Status429TooManyRequests; // Status code for rejected requests
});
```

### Sliding Window

- `AddSlidingWindowLimiter` is a rate limiting algorithm that allows a fixed number of requests within a sliding time window. It provides more flexibility than fixed window but is more complex to implement.
- It introduces the concept of segments, which allows for more granular control over request limits. Each segment can have its own limit, and the algorithm tracks requests across segments to enforce the overall limit.
  - Segment interval = `WindowTime / SegmentsPerWindow`

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.AddSlidingWindowLimiter("sliding", options =>
    {
        options.PermitLimit = 5; // Maximum number of requests
        options.Window = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1); // Time window
        options.SegmentsPerWindow = 4; // Number of segments in the window
        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst; // Order of processing requests
        options.QueueLimit = 2; // Maximum number of requests in the queue
    });
    options.RejectionStatusCode = StatusCodes.Status429TooManyRequests; // Status code for rejected requests
});
```

- In this example, the sliding window is divided into 4 segments, each with a limit of 5 requests. The total limit is still 5 requests, but the sliding window allows for more flexibility in request timing.

### Token Bucket

- `AddTokenBucketLimiter` is a rate limiting algorithm that allows a burst of requests up to a certain limit, then enforces a steady rate. It uses tokens to control the rate of requests.
- The number of tokens in the bucket represents the number of requests that can be made. Tokens are added to the bucket at a specified rate, and requests consume tokens from the bucket.
- If there are no tokens available, the request is rejected or queued.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.AddTokenBucketLimiter("token", options =>
    {
        options.TokenLimit = 10; // Maximum number of tokens in the bucket
        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst; // Order of processing requests
        options.QueueLimit = 2; // Maximum number of requests in the queue
        options.ReplenishmentPeriod = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5); // Time period for replenishing tokens
        options.TokensPerPeriod = 1; // Number of tokens added per period
        options.AutoReplenishment = true; // Automatically replenish tokens
    });
    options.RejectionStatusCode = StatusCodes.Status429TooManyRequests; // Status code for rejected requests
});
```

### Simultaneous Connections

- `AddConcurrentRequestLimiter` is a rate limiting algorithm that limits the number of concurrent requests from a single client. It is useful for preventing resource exhaustion due to too many simultaneous connections.
- It defines a maximum number of concurrent requests that can be made from a single client. If the limit is reached, additional requests are rejected or queued.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(options =>
{
    options.AddConcurrentRequestLimiter("concurrent", options =>
    {
        options.PermitLimit = 5; // Maximum number of concurrent requests
        options.QueueProcessingOrder = QueueProcessingOrder.OldestFirst; // Order of processing requests
        options.QueueLimit = 2; // Maximum number of requests in the queue
    });
    options.RejectionStatusCode = StatusCodes.Status429TooManyRequests; // Status code for rejected requests
});
```
