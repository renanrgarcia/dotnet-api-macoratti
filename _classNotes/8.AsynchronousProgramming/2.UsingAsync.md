# Using Async

- The core is to use `Task` and `Task<T>` objects to represent asynchronous operations.
- Syntax:

```csharp
public async Task<T> MethodNameAsync<T>(parameters) // Async suffix is a convention, doesn't affect the code
{
    return await _context.Set<T>().ToListAsync(); // await initially returns a Task object, and when the operation is completed, it returns the result.
}
```

## Return types

- **void**: used for async event handlers. It is not recommended to use `async void` for other methods, as it can lead to unhandled exceptions and makes it difficult to await the completion of the method. We must use `async Task` instead, because it allows us to await the method and handle exceptions properly. Ex:

```csharp
public async void OnButtonClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    await SomeAsyncMethod();
    Console.WriteLine("Button clicked.");
}
```

- **Task**: used for async methods that do not return a value. It represents an asynchronous operation that may or may not have a result. It is always allocated on the heap. Ex:

```csharp
public async Task SomeAsyncMethod()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    Console.WriteLine("Async method completed.");
}
```

- **Task<T>**: used for async methods that return a value of type `T`. It represents an asynchronous operation that returns a result of type `T`. It is always allocated on the heap.
  - The type `T` can be any type, including primitive types (int, string, etc.), custom classes, or collections.
    Ex:

```csharp
public async Task<int> SomeAsyncMethodWithResult()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
    return 42; // Return a result
}
```

- **ValueTask**: `struct` used for async methods that may return a value immediately or in the future. It can be allocated on the stack, reducing heap allocations and improving performance in certain scenarios. It is recommended to use `ValueTask` when the result is likely to be available immediately, and the overhead of allocating a `Task` is unnecessary. Ex:

```csharp
public async ValueTask<int> SomeAsyncMethodWithValueTask()
{
    if (/* some condition */)
    {
        return 42; // Return a result immediately
    }
    else
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
        return 42; // Return a result later
    }
}
```

- **ValueTask<T>**: `struct` used for async methods that return a value of type `T` and may be allocated on the stack. It is similar to `ValueTask`, but it is a generic type that allows us to specify the type of the result. It is recommended to use `ValueTask<T>` when the result is likely to be available immediately, and the overhead of allocating a `Task<T>` is unnecessary. Ex:

```csharp
public async ValueTask<string> SomeAsyncMethodWithValueTaskT()
{
    if (/* some condition */)
    {
        return "Hello"; // Return a result immediately
    }
    else
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
        return "World"; // Return a result later
    }
}
```

- **IAsyncEnumerable<T>**: used for asynchronous streaming of data. It allows us to iterate over a sequence of values asynchronously, without blocking the calling thread. It is useful for scenarios where we want to process a large amount of data in a streaming fashion, such as reading from a database or an external API. Ex:

```csharp
public async IAsyncEnumerable<int> SomeAsyncMethodWithIAsyncEnumerable()
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate an asynchronous operation
        yield return i; // Return a value
    }
}
```

- **IAsyncDisposable**: used for asynchronous disposal of resources. It allows us to implement the `DisposeAsync` method, which can be awaited to release unmanaged resources asynchronously. It is useful for scenarios where we want to dispose of resources without blocking the calling thread.
- **IAsyncDisposable<T>**: used for asynchronous disposal of resources of type `T`. It allows us to implement the `DisposeAsync` method, which can be awaited to release unmanaged resources asynchronously. It is useful for scenarios where we want to dispose of resources of a specific type without blocking the calling thread.
- **IAsyncEnumerator<T>**: used for asynchronous enumeration of a sequence of values of type `T`. It allows us to implement the `MoveNextAsync` and `Current` methods, which can be awaited to iterate over a sequence of values asynchronously. It is useful for scenarios where we want to enumerate a sequence of values without blocking the calling thread.
- **IAsyncEnumerator**: used for asynchronous enumeration of a sequence of values. It allows us to implement the `MoveNextAsync` and `Current` methods, which can be awaited to iterate over a sequence of values asynchronously.
