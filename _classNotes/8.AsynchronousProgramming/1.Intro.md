# Asynchronous Programming

- Benefits:
  - Non-blocking I/O: Allows other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
  - Improved performance: Can handle multiple tasks concurrently, leading to better resource utilization.
  - Scalability: Can manage a large number of connections or requests without blocking the main thread.
  - Responsiveness: Keeps applications responsive by not blocking the main thread during long-running operations.
- `Threads` vs `Tasks`:
  - Threads: Low-level constructs for parallel execution, managed by the operating system.
  - Tasks: Higher-level abstractions for asynchronous programming, managed by the .NET Task Scheduler.
- `async` and `await` keywords:
  - `async`: Marks a method as asynchronous, allowing the use of `await` within it.
  - `await`: Pauses the execution of the method until the awaited task completes, without blocking the thread.
- Types of resources management:
  - `Horizontal scaling`: Adding more machines to handle increased load. Aiming to distribute the load across multiple servers.
  - `Vertical dimensioning`: Adding more resources (CPU, memory) to a single machine. Aiming to increase the capacity of a single server.
- It doesn't mean that the code will run faster, but it will be more efficient in terms of resource usage.
- `Task` vs `ValueTask`:
  - `Task`: Represents an asynchronous operation that may or may not have a result. It is always allocated on the heap.
  - `ValueTask`: Represents a value that may be available immediately or in the future. It can be allocated on the stack, reducing heap allocations and improving performance in certain scenarios.

## Synchronous Programming

- There are a thread pool and a thread stack.
  - The `thread pool` is a collection of threads that can be used to perform tasks concurrently. It is managed by the operating system and allows for efficient use of system resources.
  - The `thread stack` is a region of memory allocated for each thread to store local variables, method parameters, and return addresses. It is used to manage the execution context of the thread.
- The `thread pool` is used to manage the execution of tasks, while the `thread stack` is used to manage the execution context of each thread.
- When a request is made to a web server, the server creates a new thread from the thread pool to handle the request. The thread executes the request and returns the response to the client. Once the request is completed, the thread is returned to the thread pool for reuse.
  - When the requests number increases, and there are no available threads, the request must wait until a thread is available. This can lead to performance issues and increased response times.

## Asynchronous Programming - Thread uses

- In this case, the threads are not blocked, and the server can handle other requests while waiting for the I/O operation to complete. This allows for better resource utilization and improved performance.
- So, the vertical dimensioning is optimized in this case, as the server can handle more requests without blocking threads.

## When it's recommended

- `Database access`: retrieve or update data from a database.
- `File I/O`: read or write files to disk or communicate with peripheral devices.
- `Web requests`: make HTTP requests to external APIs or services.
- `Long-running computations`: perform complex calculations or data processing tasks that may take a significant amount of time to complete.
- `Improve scalability`: handle a large number of concurrent requests without blocking threads.
- `Mantain responsiveness`: keep the application responsive and avoid freezing or hanging during long-running operations.
- But the misuse of async can lead to performance issues, such as concurrency problems, deadlocks, and increased complexity. It is important to use async judiciously and only when necessary.
