# Authentication and Authorization

- `Authentication` is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity is who they claim to be.
- `Authorization` is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to access a specific resource or perform a specific action. It ensures that the entity has the necessary permissions to access the resource.
- `Authentication` is about identity, while `Authorization` is about permissions.

## Types of implementation on .NET

- `Identity`: A membership system that adds login functionality to ASP.NET applications. It provides a way to manage user accounts, roles, and claims.
- `External authentication`: Allows users to log in using their existing accounts from external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter). It simplifies the login process for users and reduces the need for them to create new accounts.
- Server-side authentication:
  - `Identity Server`
  - `OpenId`
  - `Azure AD`
  - Etc.
- `JWT (JSON Web Token)`: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used for stateless authentication and authorization in web applications. JWTs are signed and can be verified by the server without needing to store session information.
  - Also known as `Bearer Token Authentication`.

## Authentication Schemes

- `Bearer Authentication`: A token-based authentication scheme where the client sends a token in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request. The server verifies the token and grants access to the requested resource if the token is valid.
  - Can be understood as "give access to the bearer of the token".
- `Anonymous Authentication`: A scheme that allows unauthenticated users to access certain resources without requiring authentication. It is typically used for public resources that do not require user identification.
- `Basic Authentication`: A simple authentication scheme where the client sends a username and password in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request. The server verifies the credentials and grants access to the requested resource if they are valid. Uses Base64 encoding to encode the credentials, but it is not secure as the credentials can be easily decoded. It is recommended to use HTTPS to encrypt the communication when using Basic Authentication.
