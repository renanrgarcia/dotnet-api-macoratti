# JWT

- JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- The transmission can be done through URL, POST parameter, or HTTP header. The information is digitally signed by an algorithm (HMAC SHA256 or RSA).
- Cryptographed tokens are used to verify the authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the message.

## JWT Structure

- JWT consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.
- Each part is Base64Url encoded and separated by dots (.).
- The structure is as follows:
  - Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the signing algorithm used.
  - Payload: Contains the claims or assertions about the user or system. It can include information such as user ID, roles, and expiration time.
  - Signature: Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.

## Benefits

- Stateless: JWTs are self-contained and do not require server-side storage. This makes them suitable for distributed systems and microservices architectures.
- DataBase independent: JWTs can be used across different databases and systems, as they do not rely on server-side sessions.
- Agnostic: JWTs can be used with any programming language or platform that supports JSON and Base64 encoding.

## Steps to create/validate a JWT

1. The client sends a request to the server with the user's credentials (username and password).
2. The server verifies the credentials on the database and checks if the user is valid.
3. If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.
   and generates a JWT if they are valid.
4. The client stores the JWT (usually in local storage or a cookie) and includes it in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests to access protected resources.
5. The server receives the request with the JWT and verifies its signature and claims (e.g., expiration time, issuer).
6. If the JWT is valid, the server processes the request and returns the requested resource. If the JWT is invalid or expired, the server returns an error response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized). If there's no authorization header, the server returns a 403 Forbidden response.
7. The server can also revoke or invalidate the JWT by changing the signing key or implementing a token blacklist.
8. The client can refresh the JWT by sending a refresh token to the server, which generates a new JWT if the refresh token is valid.
9. The server can also implement token expiration and renewal policies to ensure that JWTs are valid for a limited time and require periodic renewal.

## Steps to JWT implementation

- Generate the token (or Refresh token)
  - Verify the credentials (username and password)
  - Define the claims (user ID, roles, etc.)
  - Define the secret key and algorithm (HMAC SHA256 or RSA)
  - Generate the token based on the emissor, audience, claims, secret key and define the expiration time
- Validate the token
  - Verify the signature and claims (expiration time, issuer, audience)
  - Check if the token is blacklisted (if applicable)
  - If valid, process the request and return the requested resource
  - If invalid or expired, return an error response (401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden)
